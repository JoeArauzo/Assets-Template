== Background
If you prefer to use Github Gists as way to publish How-To articles, you've already realized you can author your articles in any markup languge https://github.com/github/markup#markups[supported by GitHub]. Many just getting started prefer using Markdown because it is easy to learn. I personally prefer https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoc] because it's just as easy to learn and offers the ability to do things Markdown simply can't.  For example, nested tables, includes, CSV imports, just to name a few. Or perhaps you'd like to take the same article you already wrote and be able to export it as a PDF or EPUB, with many options for customizing the format.  With AsciiDoc and something like https://antora.org/[Antora], you can even create whole https://docs.antora.org/[documentation websites]. If you have plans or aspirations to do any of these things, you can choose to learn AsciiDoc and be able to do them all by using a single markup language. +

While it is technically possible to upload an image file to a gist, it doesn't offer a way to use the image inline within your article. And I'm sure you can agree, a complex How-To article without any images can be pretty boring. A picture is worth a thousand words. So one approach is to setup a GitHub repository dedicated to centrally hosting assets such as images. Those images can then be referenced via URLs in your How-To article, or anything else for that matter. The following provides instructions for how to host your images on GitHub for _free_.


== Getting Started
To get started, you simply need to clone this repository. I recommend naming your repository something short and sweet, like `assets`.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/JoeArauzo/Assets-Template.git assets
----

[NOTE]
The repository you've just created needs to be a public repository in order for this to work.
 

== Usage
Once you have a local copy of your repository, you can begin hosting image assets by simply copying files into your directory of choice, followed by pushing the repo back to GitHub. +
This repo includes a directory named `images` by default. The logo at the top of this README is an example of an image asset stored in the repo.

[source]
----
└── assets
    ├── CHANGELOG.adoc
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── images
    │   └── readme-logo.jpg
    └── readme.adoc

----

As an example, if you right-click the logo at the top of this README, copy the image address, paste it back into the address bar of your web browser and press `Enter`, the address would resolve to the following URL.

----
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoeArauzo/Assets-Template/main/images/readme-logo.jpg
----

If we take a closer look at the URL, we can derive the following pattern.

----
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{github_user_name}/{repo_name}/{branch}/images/{asset_name}.{asset_extension}
----

It's as simple as that.  As a trial test, try copying your own image asset into the `images` directory, then run the following git commands to push the repo back to GitHub so the change takes effect.

[source,bash]
----
git add .
git commit -m 'Add test image'
git push
----

Now point your browser at your GitHub repo and navigate to the `images` directory.
Assuming you named your image asset `test-image.jpg`, click the *Download* button listed on the page to reveal the image asset URL in the address bar of your browser.

You should see something similar to the following.

----
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoeArauzo/Assets-Template/main/images/test-image.jpg
----

You can now use this URL within your article to render the image inline.  Enjoy!
